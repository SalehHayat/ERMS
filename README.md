<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p align="justify">
We are introducing an Android application for Employee Rewarding and Management. This application having two main functions; one is Rewarding and another one is Management. First, we have to talk about Management System. Office management is very important in every organization. It helps to improve efficiency and effectiveness. So, our goal is to manage office work with ERMS (Employee Rewarding and Management System). The application will manage and keep a record of employee attendance, work, salary slips, summary reports and events information.
Now the Rewarding System. As we know in organizations, there are multiple employees who working in different offices. Appreciation is certainly an essential human need that should never be discounted, as employees will respond positively to any sort of appreciation that comes their way. When their work is valued by others it means their satisfaction rises and productivity increases too. In order to create a thriving workplace, praise and recognition are going to be fundamental elements. As long as people are respected for their efforts and contribution, they will feel a sense of achievement and keep striving to reach this in every task they undertake. Our plan is to make such type application to manage employee’s performance in a better way.

<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
<p align="justify">
For business owners and managers, it might seem like a lot of extra effort to implement an employee rewards program. This can be especially so when the results aren’t always immediate and tangible when it comes to their employees’ performances. Employee reward has been proven to improve organizational values, enhance team efforts, increase customer satisfaction and motivate certain behaviors amongst members of staff.

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p align="justify">
	We get motivated by the current environment in the different organizations by seeing the employee’s frustration after so much of hard working and also do their tasks on time and not get any appreciation neither bonus. That's why they leave that Organization and join the other who' s been kind to employees so by using that Android application the organization manager will be well informed all over the employees and giving them tasks specifically to each and checking their work and give them a bonus or even promotion if he/she deserve.
